        <p>I am a brazilian Mechatronics Technician with a hands on background in the HVAC field. The last years
          I have worked mainly with facilities maintenance. Due to the <em>COVID-19</em> pandemic,
          I have been laid off. After reflecting about the fragility of our carreers, the fear of failure
          and how it can hinder our personal progress in general, it's very clear that we can lost confidence
          in our capacity to endure hard times or even facing new challanges, whether voluntarily or not.
        </p>
        <p>I am switching to the web development field, facing a new challenge. So, I decided to create an online
          portifolio for my projects, leaving my digital "footprints" as I go along this new road, seeking new
          opportunities and personal improvement.

  <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
  <p>I love woodworking. I'm mainly a handtool's guy. Theres nothing like the sensation of being able to create
    things with your own hands. I also enjoy astrophotography, even though it is difficult to observe (let alone
    photograph) the nightsky in the city where I live, due to light pollution... :(
